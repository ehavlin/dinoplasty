Dinosaurs!

## Day 3 Homework

* Store the dinosaurs in an array, as well as in the DOM.

### Mega Bonus Credit

* Add a promote/fav button, just like you did yesterday!
* Add a delete button, just like yesterday!

### Super Mega Bonus Credit

* Add buttons to move a dinosaur up and down the list.

### Super Mega Bonus Credit Hyper Fighting

* Persist the dinosaur data using `window.localStorage`. The dinosaurs should stay in the list even when the page is refreshed.

## Day 4 Homework

* Fix the issue with dino id values, which sometimes results in removing the wrong dinosaur from the array (and thus from 'localStorage').

### Bonus Credit 

* Add another field to the form, and make sure that data (such as eating habits, era in which it lived, etc.) also persists across page loads.
* Make it look nice.

### Super Mega Bonus Credit

* Edit the names of dinosaurs that are already in the list (and make sure the changes persist across page laods). Gee, it would be nice if we could make that span's _content editable_ somehow.

### Super Mega Bonus Credit Hyper Fighting

* Have a good weekend.
